# Customer Segmentation with K-means Clustering

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. Customer segmentation helps in better understanding and targeting different customer groups with tailored marketing strategies. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior.

## Kaggle Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the K-means clustering algorithm is sourced from Kaggle. It includes information about customers' purchase history, such as the amount spent, frequency of purchases, and types of products purchased.

Please download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory before running the code.

## Model Used
We have implemented the K-means clustering algorithm for customer segmentation. K-means is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data points into k clusters based on their features. In this context, it helps identify different customer segments with similar purchasing patterns.

The model is trained on the provided dataset, and the resulting clusters are analyzed to gain insights into customer behavior.
